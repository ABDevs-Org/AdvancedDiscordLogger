# CentralizedDiscordSystem

**Advanced Discord Logger** is a very powerful event logging tool for big network server owners.
This system will allow owners to host a Discord Bot on their **Spigot/Paper Server** and perform certain actions like sending/receiving messages. In order to keep the load as low as possible, all the processes are async.

**NOTE: This system is still very new and in Heavy Development. So expect some bugs and breaking API changes.**
